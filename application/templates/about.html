            <h3> About this Project </h3> 
        <div class = "col-md-12 text-center">
            <p> I am a graduating senior at Carthage College majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. I am very interested in technology and machine learning, but I 
                also play viola in the Carthage Philharmonic and have always had a passion for music. To combine these two interests, I decided to do my senior thesis 
                on whether it is possible to predict the "enjoyability" of a piece of music by the raw data that we can extract from an mp3 recording. In order to do this, 
                I collected 88 recordings of "Happy Birthday" in varying skill levels, instruments, and pitches. I then collected almost 600 ratings on that data, which indicated how 
                much the reviewers enjoyed the performance. Using this raw data, I have implemented different regression and classification models to try to best predict how "good" a recording is, and ultimately
                landed on using a Ridge Regression model. This model currently performs with an error rate of just over 5%, and I hope that the additional data that I collect here will continue to improve this model. </p>
